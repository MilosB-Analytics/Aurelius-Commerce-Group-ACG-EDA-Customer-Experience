For this project we were given the following business questions:

-- Which support channels correlate with poor satisfaction?
-- Does response time actually impact CSAT—or is that assumed?
-- Are repeat customers more forgiving than first-time buyers?
-- Do delivery delays hurt NPS equally across product categories?
-- Which are high value customers and what is the risk of loosing them?

For each of these we have tailored the raw data so that we may manipulate it in a way to answer them and visualize so that we may provide clear insights to non-techincal shareholders

-- Which support channels correlate with poor satisfaction?

For this question we have added a clustered bar chart where we have measured total positive & negative scores per channel and what we found was that the most utilized channels are both 'Phone' and 'Email' with both of them having nearly double the usage of the other two channels.

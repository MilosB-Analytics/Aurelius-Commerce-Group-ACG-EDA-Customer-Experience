Aurelius-Commerce-Group-ACG-EDA-Customer-Experience is a mid-to-large omnichannel e-commerce retailer and they have markets in both North America & Western Europe.
ACG has grown aggressively over the past 3 years. Revenue is strong—but leadership is uneasy. With a steady influx of negative reviews coming in.
Shareholders are determined to get to the root cause of the issues the company is facing, as such the following questions were raised:

❗ Questions: 

⁉️ Which support channels correlate with poor satisfaction?
⁉️ Does response time actually impact CSAT—or is that assumed?
⁉️ Are repeat customers more forgiving than first-time buyers?
⁉️ Do delivery delays hurt NPS equally across product categories?
⁉️ Which are high value customers and what is the risk of loosing them?

✅ Answers:

✔️ The main drivers of poor satisfaction scores are coincidently the most utilized channels(Phone & Email), with the Phone channel being the only one that has a positive ratio of 0.54 as for the worst score ratio that would be the  in-App channel  with an average of -1.74.
✔️ The short answer is No, the data shows that response time is almost identical across both positive and negative reviews.
✔️ Yes, loyal/returning customers have an overall higher satisfaction rate and a lower un-satisfaction rate.
✔️ Yes, we can see that the overall delays are the same across all products.
✔️ 60% of the highest value customers are from the United States and 30% are from Germany, the risk of losing them is high as their average score comes up to a -0.22.

A more in-depth analysis with on how were these answers derived can be found in the Data Vizualization & Storytelling file.
